Once upon a time you made a website for a restaurant franchise. Now and after hearing about the wonderful work you did the owner is calling you back to implement new features and improve the website.

Sadly, he can only pay you for a week of work, which won’t be enough time to implement all his ideas. Hopefully, he’s ready to make compromises, you have to implement as much as you can in the given time.
